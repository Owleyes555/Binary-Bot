Please masters in the house, I have a binary bot which I use in trading, everything works fine, but I want you to help me add the function of "Trade after XX seconds" after a particular trade, it will have to wait until that "XX" seconds is reached, before it trades another one, please can you help me, i will upload the bot here. Thanks
